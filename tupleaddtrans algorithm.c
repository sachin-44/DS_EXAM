Define a structure named matrix with attributes row, col, and value.

Create a function named input that takes a 2D array, number of rows, and number of columns as parameters and inputs the matrix elements.

Create a function named conversion that takes a 2D array, number of rows, number of columns, and an array of structures as parameters. This function converts the matrix to a tuple form and returns the number of non-zero elements.

Create a function named display that takes an array of structures and its size as parameters and displays the matrix in tuple form.

Create a function named transpose that takes an array of structures, an array for the transposed matrix, and the number of non-zero elements. This function transposes the matrix and stores the result in the transposed array.
Create a function named add that takes two arrays of structures representing matrices, their sizes, and an array for the result. This function performs matrix addition and returns the number of non-zero elements in the result.
In the main function:
Declare variables r1, c1, r2, c2, k, d, and v.
Declare 2D arrays matA and matB for the matrices.
Declare arrays of structures mat1, mat2, trans, and res for the tuple forms, transpositions, and result of matrices.
Input matrices matA and matB.
Convert matrices to tuple form and display them.
Transpose matrices and display the result.
Perform matrix addition and display the result.
